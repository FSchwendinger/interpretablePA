## Project description

### Target audience

`interpretablePA` was created for researchers and clinicians interested in measuring human movement using raw-acceleration accelerometers in various populations or individuals.

### Practical application

This package supports the use of cut-point-free accelerometer metrics, namely daily average acceleration (AvAcc) and intensity gradient (IG), to assess physical activity. AvAcc and IG have been shown to be a viable alternative to traditional metrics and are strongly related to various health outcomes.

The `interpretablePA` package contains an application that can classify physical activity levels based on age- and sex-specific reference values and translate cut-point-free accelerometer metrics into meaningful outcomes. Reference values are based on a population sample of 463 healthy adults aged 20 to 89 years in Switzerland who wore the GENEActiv on their non-dominant wrist for up to 14 days.

`interpretablePA` requires data processed using the R-package GGIR in a similar manner. GGIR supports the processing of multi-day raw accelerometer data for physical activity and sleep research. See the GGIR package [vignette](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/GGIR/vignettes/GGIR.html) for further information.

## Installation

You can install the package from GitHub by typing the following:

```{r installation, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("remotes")

remotes::install_github("FSchwendinger/interpretablePA")

```

After installation, load it in R using `library(interpretablePA)` and start the application by running `interpret.pa()`.

## Examples

The below images will give you some insights into the package. A typical workflow could be:

1.  The user run installs and loads `interpretablePA` and runs `interpret.pa()`. This starts the application.

2.  The user decides what data format they want to enter (data of an individual, pooled means/medians of a whole study cohort that are stratified by sex or not, or data of several individuals with sample size = N) and selects the respective option under panel "*1) User data*".

3.  Assuming the user decides to enter data of one individual (see Figure 1), they would fill in all the fields, i.e. sex, age, height, body weight, average acceleration, and intensity gradient; then press "Calculate".

    **Figure 1.** One of three data entry options the user can utilize.

4.  Panels "2) View results" (see Figure 2) and "3) Translation of results" (see Figure 3) are now accessible.

5.  The user can find out the exact percentile the individual is on compared to our reference values and download centile plots.

    **Figure 2.** Example of graphical output. Green dots are the data entered by the user.

6.  In panel "3) Translation of results", the user is provided with information on a) what is necessary for the individual to reach the 50th percentile or increase their physical activity by 5%, b) which changes would be needed to achieve a clinically relevant improvement in cardiorespiratory fitness, and c) how much more physical activity would need to be performed to reduce the risk of death and disease.

**Figure 3.** Example of the translation of results.
