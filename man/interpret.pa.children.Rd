\arguments{
\item{dat_path}{Character. Path to the file containing subject characteristics (CSV or Excel).}

\item{part2_path}{Character. Path to the GGIR \code{part2_summary.csv} file.}

\item{output_path}{Character. Full path where the output CSV should be saved.}

\item{col_id}{Character. Column name for participant ID.}

\item{col_sex}{Character. Column name for sex.}

\item{col_age}{Character. Column name for age.}

\item{sex_code_male}{Character. Encoding for male sex in the dataset (e.g., "0").}

}
\value{
A data frame with subject ID, sex, age, AvAcc and IG values, and their predicted centiles.
Also writes the resulting data to a CSV file.
}
\description{
This function integrates subject demographic data with GGIR part 2 summary output,
and predicts age- and sex-specific centiles for average acceleration (AvAcc) and
intensity gradient (IG) using internal reference datasets included in the package.
The merged data is written to the specified output path.
